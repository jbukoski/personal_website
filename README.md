#### A personal website for Jacob J. Bukoski

The website is built with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and is deployed by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I  edited the [Hugo Coder Portofolio](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder-portfolio/) theme by Yusuke Ishimi to fit my aesthetic tastes.
