#### Philosophy

My teaching methods are designed to strengthen students' critical thinking skills and resourcefulness. My goal in teaching is to enforce three qualities I deem critical for success in any professional field: 

  1. an appreciation and preference for information free of potential bias, 
  2. systematic, critical questioning of the assumptions that lay the foundation of your worldview, and 
  3. the ability to seek out answers and solutions that may not be readily accessible.

I have taught a number of courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. I have also co-instructed a number of intensive week-long [trainings](http://spatial-ecology.net/international-summer-school-geo-computation-using-free-and-open-source-software-berkely-2018/) on the use of open source software for processing of massive spatial datasets. A select list of these courses and workshops is provided below.
