I am broadly interested in the ecology, management and restoration of forests, with a geographic focus on the tropics and western North America. My research occurs through the combination of different data types and approaches - field inventories, statistical modeling, spatial analyses, and critical document review. Given the interdisciplinary nature of forest management, I apply these to both social and ecological systems.

For my dissertation research, I am exploring these topics through the conservation of mangrove forests. Specifically, I seek to understand the social and environmental impacts of mangrove loss as well as design avenues for their restoration and conservation in Thailand. My work has been used in a [**regional-scale project**](https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/grants/regional-grant-facilities/income-for-coastal-communities-for-mangrove-protection/) designed to support local communities in conserving mangroves.

As my research has a strong applied component, I also develop data-driven tools to inform environmental decision-making, particularly for those without extensive resources or specialist support. For example, I have collaborated with the Indian Land Tenure Foundation to develop a [**suite of webmaps**](http://iltf.sig-gis.com) for hosting and querying natural resource data.

Questions, feedback, or ideas for collaboration are always welcome. Get in touch with me at **jbukoski at berkeley.edu**.
