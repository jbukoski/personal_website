I am broadly interested in the ecology, management and restoration of forests, with a geographic focus on the tropics and western North America. My research occurs through the combination of different data types and approaches - field inventories, statistical modeling, spatial analyses, and critical document review. Given the interdisciplinary nature of forest management, I apply these to both social and ecological systems. Broadly speaking, I have explored these topics through mangrove forests and monoculture plantations. As my research has a strong applied component, I also develop data-driven tools to inform environmental decision-making, particularly for those without extensive resources or specialist support.

Questions, feedback, or ideas for collaboration are always welcome!
