I am an environmental scientist focused on the ecology, management and restoration of forests, globally. Currently, I am not pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/jacob-bukoski) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am also a [Data Science for the 21st Century](http://ds421.berkeley.edu/) fellow at U.C. Berkeley, in which I integrate data science practices into environmental projects. I have been fortunate enough to work in forests across the globe - including Thailand, Vietnam, Vanuatu, Brazil, California, and New England. I completed my MS at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale University and my undergraduate studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I am also an Associate Editor at the [Journal of Sustainable Forestry](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/wjsf20/current).
