#### Opportunities

I will be recruiting graduate students in the Department of Forest Ecosystems & Society for Fall 2023. Please check back soon for graduate school opportunities at OSU's College of Forestry!


#### Contact guidelines

I encourage individuals interested in grad school opportunities at Oregon State Univeristy to reach out. However, I receive a large number of emails and although I do my best to respond to all, your email may slip through the cracks.

Before you send an email, please review some of my recent publications and have a good understanding of my work. To help me get back to you in an efficient manner, please include in your email:

1. Your current CV, highlighting your ability to conduct applied and/or pure research

2. A short (!) description of your a) background, b) your professional goals, c) a research topic that you are interested in pursuing, and d) why you are interested in FES/working with me.
